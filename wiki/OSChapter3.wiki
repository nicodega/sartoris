#summary Creating Your OS on top of Sartoris Chapter 3: Hello World!

= Introduction =

On last chapter, we explained the boot process in a technical perspective. Now let us create the clasic _Hello World!_ example! (if you have not setup a sartoris compilation environment I suggest you do now. [Compiling Here] explains how to do it).

*SETUP*: You can download this example sources here:  [http://sartoris.googlecode.com/files/hello_world.zip hello_world.zip]

*IMPORTANT*: Make sure you extract the contents of the zip files so that sartoris folder can be located by using `../sartoris` from the example code directory (where the Makefile is).

As we explained before, the first [Threads Thread] executed on the system is the Init Thread. 

For this example we will create a C file named `start.c` with the following code:

{{{
#include "screen.h"
#include <sartoris/syscall.h>

int main() 
{
	clear_screen();
	cursor_off();

	string_print("hola, mundo!", 0, 0x7);

	while(1);
}
}}}

We'll want this code will be the one executed as the Init Thread, and that's why it has to end with `while(1)` (if it didn't, it would attempt to return from init, and that's not right).

`screen.h` and `screen.c` are VGA text printing routines necesary
