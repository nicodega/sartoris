This is the i386 Sartoris implementation. 

After compiling, a file named sartoris.img will be generated in the ./sartoris 
subdir. It is a plain binary file containing a boot-sector and a kernel image. 
In order to boot, you should raw copy this file to the desired boot media. The 
file is always an exact number of 512 byte sectors. The kernel will load the 
operating system's initialization task from the sectors immediately following 
the sartoris image in the boot media. So make sure the init image is there. If 
you are using a floppy, just raw-copy the image starting at the first sector, 
and the native (sartoris) bootsector will do fine. To boot from hard disk, DOS 
partitioning is used. Set partition type to 0xd0, and use chain loading. 
The first primary partition with type 0xd0 is used to boot.
