The following features require more testing and might not work properly, because they have never been tested:

- pop_int/push_int/resume_int
- run_thread_int
- Dynamic memory page allocation procedure
- Thread/Ports permissions.
- MemMap
- SSE (right now int7 checks for MMX, should we also check SSE?)
