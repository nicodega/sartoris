[2.0.0]	- alpha 1
	- Tasks now won't be initialized when created. I created init_task syscall for
	  that.
	- Only 4 LDT segment selectors are defined on GDT (one for each privilege level) (before version 2.0 one ldt was created for each task).
	- Dynamic memory implemented. Will issue PF to get/free pages for the microkernel.
	- Software interrupts implementation
		Allows running a thread specifying an eip and stack. Upon run
		current thread registers (C convention) and flags will remain the same.
        This can be useful to implement signals on an OS on top of sartoris.
	- MMX/FPU/SSE/SSE2/3DNOW! state preservation support on x86 arch.
	- Capabilities API (CPUID)
        Now RDTSC and RDPMC are enabled for processes.
	- Optional (#define _METRICS_) Metrics API 
		Currently only supports SMO/Messages/Ports/dynamic-memory metrics and a syscall to get the struct.
	- run_thread permission bitmaps are now implemented in user space. This might not be the best option
      but will let the OS handle te paging, and since we support so many threads now, we could not afford that on
      sartoris itself.
	- Multiboot compliant loader (hopefully).
	- Pop/Push/resume functions implemented for interrupt stack manipulation from non nested ints.
      This could be used on the OS on top to handle interrupts page faults, if they are allowed.
	- Now ports must be opened manually. Compatibility with version 0.5.3 is deprecated.
	- Kernel now loads itself from the first megabyte and up, preserving the BIOS.
	  (implemented entering Unreal Mode) and a new segment is available on the ldt for
      privilege 1 tasks.
    - new ttrace system calls for debugging. ttrace functions allow a process to inspect or set
      a thread registers (including the eip), or read/write it's memory. 
      Since this adds overhead to interrupt handling and system calls (because of the stack winding/unwinding)
      only threads being traced will incurr such overhead. Tracing can be started only by a 
      privilege 1 task, but register and memory operations are allowed to any privilege, because
      when sartoris is told to trace a thread, we must specify which task is allowed to do so.
      When tracing starts for a thread, it's state won't be accesible until it's executed for the first time
      after ttrace_begin invoke. A step int1 will be raised once the thread is executed after
      ttrace_begin. If the task tries to do anything while the thread is tracing but has never executed, 
      every ttrace function except for ttrace_end will fail.
    - Added two new messaging functions in order to check multiple port counts and receive multiple messages
      from one port at once (to avoid too many privilege switches).
    - Added three system calls to support a new event subsystem. Currently there is are two supported events:
      one will send a message to a port when a task receives a message, the other one will send a message to the port
      when an interrupt is raised. This could be usefull for schedulers, in order to put a task to sleep 
      (if the task asks for it) until a message arrives to one of it's first 32 ports or a specific int is raised.
      When/if the port is full when the event is raised, an interrupt will be triggered. Only one priv 1 
      service can handle events on the system.
      IMPORTANT: if an event wait is issued for a msg on a port or an interrupt and there is already
      a msg on the port, or the interrupt was raised before, the event wait will fail.
    - Now a single thread can handle multiple nesting interrupts at the same time. If the thread is 
      servicing an interrupt and another interrupt handled by it is raised, it'll be pushed onto the 
      int_stack immediately before the last int pushed this way or the current int.

[0.6.0] - Prerelease 8
	- Fixed smos implementation with paging.
	- Fixed offset increment on smos when reading or writing.
	- Changed memory layout.

[0.6.0] - Prerelease 7
	- New syscalls: get_current_thread, get_current_task, get_last_int
	- Paging support for x86 is partially implemented!
	- Created specific int-handling system calls. Threading and interrupt
          handling are orthogonal now.
        - Moved the interrupt stack to the arch-independent section.
          (to do: interrupt privileges and in-kernel PIC handling)
        - Modified privilege system, removing types PRC_TSK and SRV_TSK. Now
          the microkernel keeps an integer privilege level per-task, with
          zero being most privileged. Tasks of levels 0 and 1 have access to 
          the input-output space (in current implementations). Some system 
          calls are restricted to levels 0 and 1. Levels from 2 to [integer 
          size] may be used by the operating system to represent additional
          rings of protection.
        - Threading and messaging permissions may be set on a per-task basis,
          and using privilege levels (here is where the levels beyond 2 may
          be of use). 
        - IMPORTANT NOTE: All threads with privilege levels 0 or 1 start
          with the interrupt flag cleared under i386. Set it when it is
          necessary or your services will lock up the machine. [It's done this
          way to ease the implementation of interrupt handlers.]

[0.5.3] - Included new boot sector, we can load from any primary partition
          within the first ~500 MB of any BIOS addressable hard disk as well
          as from a floppy. It uses DOS partitioning, set partition type to
          0xd0. The bootable flag is, well, disregarded.

[0.5.2] - Moved Oblivion out of the Sartoris tree. 
        - Redesigned Makefiles to use an inherited compile enviroment.
        - Tested gcc 3.0.1. It works fine.
        - Implemented automatic dependency generation. See "make dep".
        - Added a new architecture: Li386emu. This is an attempt to emulate
          an i386-like architecture inside of a Linux process.
 
[0.5.1] - Lots of security enhancements in the kernel. 
        - Fix to IRQ_DRIVEN threads, now exceptions can be driven.
        - Minor enhancements and bugfixes to Oblivion.

[0.5.0] - Sartoris intial release, with Oblivion 0.01 included.
        - This is what went to the Computer Organization II people.
