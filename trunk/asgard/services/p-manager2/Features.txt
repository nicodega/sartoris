PMAN 2.0 

Internals:

- VM Sub-system
	- Page Handling             *
	- Swap File Support         *
	- Shared Memory             *
	- File Mapping              *
	- Physical Memory Mappings  *
- Modular Loader (supporting multiple executable formats, but only inplementing ELF)	+ (partial, not SO modular... but separated from the rest on loader section.)
- Exception Management          *
- Auto OFS/Swap Mount           *
- Multiboot Aware               *
- Priority/Signal driven Scheduler  *
- Non-Fixed Malloc              *
- Signaled Interrupts           *
- Init fs2 loading              * (No more layout.h, except for pman threads)

Protocols:

- Task/Thread                   *
- Signals                       *
- Std Service                   + (unloading supported)

Tested:
	- kmalloc has no bugs


Idea: Implement an LD service to hold libraries loaded on memory. When process manager loads a task, it maps the process to LD and it resolves PIC references.
This wont allow privilege level switches, those kind of things must be performed with messages.
