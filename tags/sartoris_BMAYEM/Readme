This is software under development, use at your own risk.

updated April 18, 2003.

reqyured development tools:

(only tested under Linux)

- gnu make, 
- gcc (2.96 and 3.0 work fine),
- binutils (2.10.90 works fine),
- nasm (0.98),
- perl.

To build the microkernel for the i386 architecture, do

make sartoris

Alternatively, there is a half-implemented simulated architecture 
that runs as a Linux process.

It is currently not actively mantained, and it does not work.

To build it, do

make clean
cd arch
rm -f target
ln -s Li386emu target
cd ..
make dep
make sartoris

To test this microkernel, you need a set of servers that actually do something.
Sartoris just implements the primitives.

Oblivion is a simple example of such a Sartoris-based OS. You can get it at
sartoris.sourceforge.net. To build, untar Sartoris and Oblivion in the
same directory, compile first the Sartoris sub-directory (this will build
the microkernel and a system library) and then compile the Oblivion 
sub-directory.

Oblivion will set up a Bochs (bochs.sourceforge.net) environment you can use
to play with it. It works with paging enabled, but does not use paging
for anything very useful (other than testing that paging actually works).

The documentation in .tex format is located in the doc directory, there is a 
Makefile to build it.
